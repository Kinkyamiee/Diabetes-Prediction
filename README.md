# Diabetes Prediction Project

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting diabetes status (positive or negative) using a dataset containing both medical and demographic data. The machine learning models developed in this project aim to assist healthcare professionals in identifying patients at risk of diabetes based on their medical history and demographic factors.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the **Diabetes Prediction Dataset**, which includes the following features:

- **Age**: Ranges from 0 to 80, with older adults being more susceptible to diabetes.
- **Gender**: Biological sex of the patient (Male/Female), which influences the likelihood of developing diabetes.
- **Hypertension**: A binary feature indicating the presence (1) or absence (0) of elevated blood pressure.
- **Heart Disease**: Indicates whether the patient has heart disease (1 = presence, 0 = absence).
- **Smoking History**: Categorizes the patient as a smoker or non-smoker.
- **Body Mass Index (BMI)**: A numerical measure indicating the body fat level of a person.
- **HbA1c Level**: The average blood sugar level over the past 2-3 months.
- **Blood Glucose Level**: The level of glucose in the patient's blood at the time of testing.
- **Diabetes (Target)**: The binary target variable, where 1 indicates diabetes and 0 indicates no diabetes.

## Project Structure

- **data/**: Contains the dataset files and any preprocessing scripts.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks used for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and model building.
- **models/**: Serialized machine learning models for predicting diabetes status.
- **scripts/**: Python scripts for training and evaluating the models.
- **reports/**: Project reports, including EDA summaries and model performance metrics.
  
## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA was performed to understand the structure and patterns in the data. Key EDA steps included:

- **Summary Statistics**: Calculated mean, median, and other statistics for numerical columns.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualizations such as histograms, bar charts, scatter plots, and heatmaps were used to identify patterns and correlations.
  
## Model Development

Several machine learning models were trained to predict diabetes based on the provided features. The models include:

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- XGBoost

Model performance was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Usage

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repository-link
   ```
   
2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the data preprocessing script:
   ```bash
   python scripts/preprocess_data.py
   ```

4. Train the model:
   ```bash
   python scripts/train_model.py
   ```

5. Evaluate the model:
   ```bash
   python scripts/evaluate_model.py
   ```

## Future Work

- Enhancing feature engineering, particularly incorporating additional medical factors.
- Improving the interpretability of the models to offer more actionable insights to healthcare professionals.
- Implementing a user-friendly web application for easy access and interaction with the predictive models.
